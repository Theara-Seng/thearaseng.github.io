About Me

I am a robotics and technology educator with a strong passion for embedded systems, intelligent robots, and applied artificial intelligence. I currently teach and mentor university students in areas such as robotics, IoT, computer networks, and AI-driven perception systems, with a strong emphasis on hands-on learning and real-world implementation.

My technical background spans ESP32, STM32, Raspberry Pi, and Jetson platforms, where I integrate sensors, motors, communication protocols (I2C, UART, CAN, MQTT), and cloud services into complete robotic and IoT systems. I am particularly interested in ROS 2–based robotics, mobile robot navigation, sensor fusion, and vision-based control.

In recent years, my work has increasingly focused on computer vision and AI for robotics, including object detection with YOLO, hand and gesture recognition with MediaPipe, lightweight neural networks for edge devices, and real-time deployment on embedded hardware. I enjoy guiding students through the full pipeline from dataset collection and model training to deployment and robot integration.

Beyond teaching, I actively support student teams in robotics competitions and applied research projects, encouraging innovation, teamwork, and critical thinking. My long-term goal is to build and lead a cutting-edge robotics and AI laboratory that bridges academic learning with industry-ready skills, empowering students to create impactful, intelligent systems.

I believe that technology education should be practical, experimental, and inspiring, and I continuously explore new tools and methodologies to make learning engaging and relevant in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

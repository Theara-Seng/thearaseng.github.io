Introduction to Robotics introduces students to the fundamentals of robot systems, including sensors, actuators, embedded controllers, and basic robot programming. The course emphasizes hands-on labs and real-world applications, enabling students to design, build, and control simple robotic systems.

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to the **Introduction to Robotics** course!

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of robotics, focusing on robot hardware, sensing, actuation, and basic control. Students will learn how robots perceive their environment, make decisions, and interact with the physical world through hands-on labs and projects. The course emphasizes practical implementation using real robotic platforms and sensors.

Robotics concepts will be applied to real-world scenarios such as autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and intelligent robot behavior.

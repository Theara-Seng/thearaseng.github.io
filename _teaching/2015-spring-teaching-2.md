Introduction to Internet of Things introduces students to the design and implementation of connected systems using sensors, actuators, embedded devices, cloud platforms, and user interfaces. The course emphasizes hands-on labs and real-world IoT applications such as smart homes, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation.

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to the **Introduction to Internet of Things (IoT)** course!

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of IoT, focusing on sensing, connectivity, cloud integration, and user interaction. Students will learn how physical devices collect data, communicate over the Internet, and interact with users through dashboards, mobile apps, and messaging platforms.

IoT concepts will be applied to real-world scenarios such as smart monitoring systems, remote control applications, and data-driven automation.
